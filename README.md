WalMart Sales Analysis

This repository contains SQL file for analyzing WalMart sales data.

The SQL files perform various tasks such as:

Created a new database named PROJECT to store the sales data from WalMart.

Created tables and loading data from CSV files.

Exploring the data and performing basic statistics.

Changed the data types of the columns in the sales table to match the attributes of the data. 

Added some constraints to the columns in the sales table to ensure data integrity and validity.

Performed some feature engineering on the sales table to create new columns that could provide more insights into the data. 
For example, created the time_of_day column to categorize the sales by morning, afternoon, or evening, and the day_name column to get the name of the day of the week for each sale.
